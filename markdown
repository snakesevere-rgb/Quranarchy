Example Glitchesss (Sourced from Surahs 1-5)

In The Name Of God, The Most Merciful, The Most Gracious
All praise and thanks are due to the Lord of the Worlds
The Most Merciful, The Most Gracious
Sovereign Of The Day Of Judgment
To You we turn to and To You we ask for Help
Guide us to the Well-Lit path
Not the path of those who have chosen to be led astray

to integrate a script:
1. select and open a glitch in a free image editor
2. carefully write a script and encode as a square-based image of equal size to your selected glitch
3. layer script layer over glitch layer at a low opacity using most-aesthetically pleasing layer mode
4. flatten image and export 

script recycling:
at the beginning of every script, write a sound sequence in basic language that will terminate and recycle the script

God wants ease for All of us, not hardship
